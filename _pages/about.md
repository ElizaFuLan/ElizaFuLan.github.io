I'm a new-grad graduate student from [Fu Fundation School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/), [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/). My research interest includes computer vision especially in generative models, AI safety, machine learning, and Large Language Models.

During my master program, I am very fortunate to work as a research assistant, advised by [Prof. Yingjie Lao](https://facultyprofiles.tufts.edu/yingjie-lao) in Lao Lab from [School of Electrical Engineering](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), Tufts University. Before that, I finished my undergraduate time in [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), and was advised by [Prof. Zhiyong Chen](https://faculty.sjtu.edu.cn/chenzhiyong/zh_CN/index.htm) from [School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering](https://www.seiee.sjtu.edu.cn/).

You can find my CV here: [Yuning's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Resume_New.pdf).
